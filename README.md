Adafruit_QDTech Arduino Library
===============================

1.8" TFT LCD library for Arduino and QD Tech / Samsung S6D02A1

This is a modification of the Adafruit SPI LCD library,
customised for hardware SPI and the QDTech board 
using a Samsung S6D02A1 chip.

Most changes are made to the initialisation routine but
non-Arduino code has been removed too.

The initialisation sequence comes from Henning Karlsen's
UTFT library: http://henningkarlsen.com

Using the hardware SPI pins is highly recommeneded.
	
You will also need the stock "Adafruit_GFX" library.
